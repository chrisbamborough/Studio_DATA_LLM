The project was awarded a UTS digital innovation award and was exhibited at the RAIA digital innovation awards.

Animate Networks takes Le Corbusier's Mill Owners Association building in Ahmedabad as a start point to explore techniques of spatial definition and organisation through timber strands. The project, in collaboration with [Rasmus Holst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rasmuskholst/?trk=shareTw&originalSubdomain=dk) generated geometric forms through algorithmically defined geometry using the capabilities of the [Rhino 3D](https://www.rhino3d.com/) software and the [Rhino Python](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/rhinopython/) programming language.

The project reinterpreted the Mill Owners Association building as three interconnected circulation routes configured through a self-arranging system of programmatic desires and cinematic narrative structures. The design process consisted of three computational techniques;

1. The organisation and connection of space were first explored through a force directed graph simulation. This simulation constructed a network system of nodes and links that interacted towards a self-organisation. The nodes were programmed as autonomous agents each with interacting sets of desires and used to organise the proximities of spaces. The links between agents retained the visual and physical connectivity set up through the determined network topology. The system produced multiple outcomes which provided input into the second technique.

2. From the network, an [iso-surf](https://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/Main/GMT_IsoSurf) system traced thresholds between the linking nodes to produce space defining surfaces. This system could calibrate surface generation through multiple points along each link delivering various outcomes from each tested topology. The series of thresholds that achieved the design criteria encapsulated within the brief provided the basis of the last technique.

3. Each surface threshold attained a series of characteristics informing its role in the overall architecture. These surfaces provided a basis to generate a field of point geometry each with a unique identity and set of forming instructions. To create architectural form a series of digitally generated strands representing timber strips connected these points defining different densities of enclosure as an interpretation of door openings, fenestration and wall.

The proposed building emerged through interaction and turbulence of strand components, arranged into thresholds by a codified field of internal and external forces.
